Assignment for CEU Coding course 2022

First .do file: "cleaning_arranging_bp.do", the first version of this was
deleted. It introduces data reading, cleaning, arranging, saving etc.,
so basically bulletpoints 6-11.
Second .do file: "regression_graphs_bp.do", in which I plotted some graphs
via loops and made a regression output table exported to docx.
Access the data here: https://osf.io/qyca8/ (suggested by professors)
